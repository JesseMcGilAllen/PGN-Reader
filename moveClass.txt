This is a outline for a possible move class to hold information on moves that
is consistent to the moves themselves and nothing else

Properties
----------
- NSString pieceType = piece making move
 (ie pawn, knight, king, rook, queen, bishop)
    if nil then it is a castling move
- BOOL isCastling = whether the move is a castling move or not
- BOOL isCapture = whether the move is a capture
- BOOL isCheck = whether the move is a check
- NSString  moveString = the string representation of the move
- NSString destinationSquareCoordinate = the coordinate of the destination
  square if not a castling move

An instance of the class could be created for each move in the move list
parsing process.  The advantage of seperating it out would be that it would cut
down on the work currently being written for the GameEngine class.
