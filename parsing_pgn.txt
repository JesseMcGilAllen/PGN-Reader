Ideas

- use C
- divide file by result first ( 1-0, 0-1, 1/2-1/2, *)
    - possibly use regular expressions to find occurrences,
    - split by range
    - see my use in the MovesListParser
    + possible advantages: moves would no longer be combined
    ? unknown speed comparison
- find way to improve performance of comparePrefixOf:to: method
    - find way to eliminate string creation


- Currently trying to seperate the headers into an array of header components
    - then process the headers
    + cuts down on string creation

    - problem discovered: if no moves exist in Game (just result given),
      the game is not seperated.  The games seperated after moves are played
      due to the search being for " 1-0", etc.  No moves mean no space prior.
      Possible solution: check for white space not just a string
