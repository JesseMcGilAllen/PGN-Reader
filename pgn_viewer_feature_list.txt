I am currently debating whether to make my app free or paid.
The problem I have is the rest of the apps that currently perform the PGN reader
functionality that my app is currently performs.
I have decided to make a feature list of potentials to add.

Feature List
------------
    Free
        - combine databases/database into a Split View Controller
        - support for annotated games
        - Search

    Paid
        - FEN support
        - create new database
        - create new game
        - add annotations
        - export
        - engine analysis

I think I could implement the features currently on the free list
in Version 1.0 and add the other features in updates.
