    I have been able to get PGN Reader to appear in the Open in Action Sheet in Safari.
    The next step is to handle the file that is coming in.
    The application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation: Method can be called in 
    didFinishingLaunchingWithOptions when the app isn't already open.
