I can unzip files!!!

    Unfortunalety unzipping mb sized files taxes my program too much.  
    The App hangs at the App Delegate on a black screen for entirely too long.
    Also, viewing the database table view for the first time is incredibly taxing.
    I need to look into ways of speeding that up.  I probably need to take that
    processing call out of the app delegate or at the very least put it in the
    background.

    It looks like to implement Core Data on multiple threads, I need to create
    multiple managed object contexts.  All of the contexts would point to the
    persistent store coordinator.  When the secondary managed object context
    saves, a notification is sent out telling the main context that it is time
    to update.
