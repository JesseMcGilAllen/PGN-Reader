Watching the videos I found out that everything was put into arrays
The board was stored in a array of 120 indexes 
(allowing extra squares for illegal moves").  Also utilized a lot of enums

I don't think I can do this as I am currently proceeding, I need to plan the 
Game playback though
If I don't it will end up the same way.

Board View
----------
- draw squares
- draw board
- remove pieces

Board Model
-----------
- create squares
    - configure squares
- create pieces
- add pieces to squares
- hold board representation
- hold past board representation
- castling rights
- en passant right
- king position

Move Generator
--------------



- Where do I define move rules?
    + like how pieces move, etc.

- squares or array of enums(integers)
